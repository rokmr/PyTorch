1.We expect lane lines to be nice, pure colors, such as solid white and solid yellow.
 Both solid white and solid yellow, have high saturation channel values. 
2.Pure white is bgr(255, 255, 255). Pure yellow is bgr(0, 255, 255).
 Both have high red channel values.
3.To generate our binary image at this stage, pixels that have rich red channel values will be set to white.
 (e.g. > 120 on a scale from 0 to 255)
 All other pixels will be set to black.
